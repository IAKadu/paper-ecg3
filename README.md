# Paper ECG
OSU Capstone Project 2020-21 - Natalie &amp; Julian


## Capstone

See our sprint documents [here](scrum/README.md).


## Getting Started

Follow the [set-up instructions](SETUP.md)

You should now have:

- Python 3.6.7
- Virtual environment
- All required packages

**Reminder**: Make sure your virtual environment is running! (this will happen automatically if you are using `pyenv`)

You can now run:

```
fbs run
```

This will start the interpreted version of the project.


## Dependencies

The project currently requires Python `3.6.7` to work with `fbs` (see [3.7 support issue](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs/issues/61)).


## Build Notes

- Detailed [guide](https://gist.github.com/j9ac9k/1f2858ceb84d94b7643a6558967d954d) on PyQt + fbs + macOS building and releasing.
- [Dark mode doesn't work on macOS](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4627) when `frozen`.
