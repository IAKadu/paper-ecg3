# Paper ECG
OSU Capstone Project 2020-21 - Natalie &amp; Julian

## Getting Started

Follow the [set-up instructions](SETUP.md)

You should now have:

- Python 3.6.7
- Virtual environment
- All required packages

**Reminder**: Make sure your virtual environment is running! (this will happen automatically if you are using `pyenv`)

You can now run:

```
fbs run
```

This will start the interpreted version of the project.

## Dependencies

The project currently requires Python `3.6.7` to work with `fbs` (see [3.7 support issue](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs/issues/61)).
